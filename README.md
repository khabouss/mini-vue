# mini-vue (in-progress)
An implementation of [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) library, this implementation doesn't use non of the vuejs library or functions instead it follows the same rules and logic that vuejs use, I developped this project to better understand how vuejs work under the hood.

to run the project:

```npm run i```

```npm run dev```
